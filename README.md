# CraftCorner
This is the final project for CS160.


# Our purpose
The application allows the crafter to find material near them that their fellow crafters may no longer want or need, allowing a space for one man’s trash to become another man’s treasure. A marketplace centered around crafters to barter their materials, allowing them to favorite some materials of interest, message the owners of the material, and find local items that they can have easy access to.
